adventure_skeleton.py - Skeleton code to be fleshed out to make a working game.

This code is designed to provide some experience with working with aggregated
objects.

Your mission:

1) Create a dungeon laid out like this:
0 -- 2
|    |
1 -- 3 -- 4 -- 5

2) You should start in room 0. A slimy Goblin should live in room 5.

3) The code is a success if a user can walk successfully to the Goblin, and
   speak to him.
